<h1>Devs Menu</h1>

A simple Android app that provides quick access to Developer Options on Android devices. This app serves as a useful tool for developers who need to navigate to various settings quickly.

It is a personal project for me as I need to turn on wireless debugging every day, and itâ€™s a hassle to go into the settings, so I made this app for convenience.

## Features

- Displays a simple user interface with the title "DEVS MENU".
- Provides buttons to open the Developer Settings and Device Info Settings.
- Includes a homescreen widget for quick access to settings.
- Uses a custom font for a better visual appearance.
- Supports edge-to-edge display for a modern look.
